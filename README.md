# Welcome to Placeminder

Location-aware tasks and reminders.

Ever wanted your task keeper app to remind you something only when you reach or are
already at a certain place, or perhaps you don't want your home screen filled with tasks that are not physically
possible to do right away?

For example, a reminder to grab a spare charger when you swing by the electronics store should only appear when you're
nearby that store!
